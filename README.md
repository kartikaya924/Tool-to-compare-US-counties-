# Tool-to-compare-US-counties-

This programme helps us to compare US counties of a particular state, based on Population, Population Density and Median age of Population. A k-means clustering algorithm is used to create clusters of similar counties. This tool was further used in another project, which was to estimate the effect of mask on covid cases in US counties.
